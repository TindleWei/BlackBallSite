<h2>Specific Provisions for EU Individuals</h2>
<p><strong>Accessing and Correcting Your Personal Information.</strong> At any time, you may contact BlackAdam at the address provided in the “Contact BlackAdam Studios” section herein and request to access the personal data that BlackAdam holds about you. BlackAdam may need to ask you to provide certain information to make sure you are who you claim to be. If you find the information on your account is not accurate, complete or updated, then please provide BlackAdam with the necessary information to correct it.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawing Your Consent.</strong> Contact us if you would like to withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data. Exercising this right will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.</p>
<p><strong>Erasing or Restricting Access to Your Information.</strong> You may request to delete or restrict access to your personal data. We may postpone or deny your request if your personal data is in current use for providing Services or for other legitimate purposes, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
<p><strong>Transferring your Personal Data (Otherwise known as Your Right to Data Portability).</strong> You have the right to receive your personal data that you have provided us in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and the right to transmit that data to another party of your choice, where technically feasible. However, this right shall not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p><strong>Right to Make Complaint:</strong> if you consider that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
<p>If you have any concerns about the way we process your personal data, you are welcome to contact our data protection officer at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@lionstudios.cc">dataprotection@lionstudios.cc</a> or write to us at the address set forth in the “Contact BlackAdam Studios” section. We will look into your request and make good faith efforts to resolve any concern you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Security Safeguards.</strong> BlackAdam takes reasonable measures to protect your information from unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration by third parties. Although we make good faith efforts to store the information collected on the Services in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party “hackers” from illegally obtaining access to this information. We do not warrant or represent that your information will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
<p><strong>Data Retention.</strong> BlackAdam retains your personal data for as long as needed to provide you Services, unless we are required by law to delete or if BlackAdam accepts your request to delete the information. We will also retain and use your personal data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
<p><strong>Our Policy Regarding Children.</strong> We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If you are under 16, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 16 may provide any personal data. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 16, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer of Personal Data Outside Your Country.</strong> We may transfer information that we collect about you to affiliated entities, or to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. Please note that these countries and jurisdictions may not have the same data protection laws as your own jurisdiction, and we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to enable transfer of information to the U.S. and the use and disclosure of information about you, including personal data, as described in this Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Lawful Basis for Processing.</strong> On certain occasions, we process your personal data when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party, such as to provide the Services to you. We may also process your personal data to respond to your inquiries concerning our products and services.</p>
<p>On other occasions, we process your personal data where required by law. We may also process your personal data if necessary to protect your interests or the interests of a third party.</p>
<p>Additionally, we process your personal data when necessary to do so for fraud prevention, improving our network and services, and marketing our services to advertisers and publishers; where these interests are not overridden by your data protection rights. </p>
<p>If the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no other lawful basis for such processing, we will generally ensure that consent has been obtained from you. You have the right to withdraw your consent to processing of personal data at any time.</p>
<p>For questions about data processing, please contact our Data Protection Officer. Visit the “Contact BlackAdam Studios” section below for contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to This Policy.</strong> We may update this Policy to reflect changes to our data and information privacy practices.

Please note that if BlackAdam needs to adapt the policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective immediately or as required. </p>
